Erlware Commons
===============

Erlware commons can best be described as an extension to the
[stdlib application](http://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/stdlib/index.html)
that is distributed with Erlang. These are things that we at
[Erlware](http://www.erlware.org) have found useful for production
applications but are not included with the distribution. We hope
that as things in this library prove themselves useful, they will make
their way into the main Erlang distribution. However, whether they do
or not, we hope that this application will prove generally useful.

### Goals for the project

* Generally Useful Code
* High Quality
* Well Documented
* Well Tested

How To Use the Code
-------------------

In general the [erldocs](http://erlware.github.com/erlware_commons)
will describe how to use each module in the application. There is some
additional information that is useful, but for the most part it's all
there.

Generally Useful Code
---------------------

We are trying to keep the code base clean, so we only accept code into
the application that has proven to be useful in multiple projects over
the course of years (generally). This shouldn't be a dumping ground
for everything that *might* be useful in random projects.

High Quality
------------

Every piece of Erlware code gets peer reviewed by one or more of the
core committers (there are four of us at the moment) before it ever
makes it into a canonical Erlware repo. We all write Erlang code for a
living and care alot about quality. It is our hope that this makes the
Erlware Commons code, and Erlware code in general, some of the best
out there.

Well Documented
---------------

We have some minimal standards for documentation that are required
(public apis have to be spec'd and commented). However, it's very
difficult to standardize 'well documented'. That's one of the nice
places code review comes in. We all have a good feel for what 'well
documented' is and we try to make sure that happens for all the code.

Well Tested
-----------

For Erlware Commons we have a hard requirement that we get 75% test
coverage on every module in the system as reported by the Erlang Cover
application. In many modules we have much better coverage, but 75% is
the minimum. Things don't go into Erlware Commons without being well
tested, period. Again, we hope that this will lead to usable, durable
code base.

Conclusion
----------

Dig in, use the code. We hope it's as helpful to you as it is to us.
